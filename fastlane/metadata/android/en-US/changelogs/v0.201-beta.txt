# v0.201-beta - fix bug in `alarmReceiver`

The `alarmReceiver` was still using the old database that *should* be empty. I use `room` database
management now.

# v0.200-beta â€“ New semantic version number (VRelease.MajorMinorPatch)

**REMEMBER** Pilldroid is a French people user only.

I made a lot a tests but there must stay some bugs.

## What's new

A lot of things under the surface :
- Add an alert about non responsibility of the author in case of trouble;
- Using `Room` to manage databases;
- Migration of the old database to the new one, you should not see anything;
- Code cleaning.

## What should work.
- QR-code scan on a dark background. The library have an option for that.


**WARNING**, Pilldroid does not manage creams, liquids
(like insulin).
